## Radar Simulation in 2D Cartesian System

Welcome to the Radar Simulation project! This repository contains the code to simulate a radar system in a 2D Cartesian plane using Python. The radar scans the environment, detects objects within a specified radius and angle, and displays the results. This project demonstrates the concepts of asynchronous programming, object-oriented design, and geometric computations.

### Features

- Simulate a 2D radar system scanning for objects.
- Adjustable parameters for radar radius and angle step.
- Asynchronous updates to the radar and world objects.
- Visual output of detected objects.

#### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/radar-simulation.git
   ```

#### Running the Simulation

1. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```sh
   cd radar-simulation
   ```

2. Run the simulation:

   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

### How It Works

- **World:** Represents the environment containing objects.
- **Object:** Defines the properties and behavior of objects in the world.
- **Radar:** Simulates a radar device, scanning the environment for objects within a certain radius and angle.
